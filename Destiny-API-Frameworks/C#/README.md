## Endpoint

### Note: Endpoint is NOT complete

The endpoint folder contains all the endpoint related things, it was my second attempt at json -> code using Newtonsoft.Json and lots of `dynamics`. It has some rough exports right now, I *believe* all **GET** requests should be working and fully set up, but I have no idea about POST, as POST has nothing implemented yet. Soon:tm:

## Enum

Enum is a folder with the enum specific stuff, it was my first attempt at json -> code manually. It only works with the specific json file given by DestinyDevs and I have no idea if it'll continue to work with updates.
